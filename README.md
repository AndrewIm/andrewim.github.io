# Opie Timed 10-Meter Walk Test
## [Website](https://andrewim.github.io/)
### User Story
As a certified Prosthetist, I need to conduct the “Timed 10 Meter Walk Test” on my patients and record the results in their medical record.  I want a simple tool to help me conduct the test and create a short text statement about the test results that I could cut and paste into my full Electronic Medical Record system.  
### Assumption
As a certified Prosthetist, I need to conduct the “Timed 10 Meter Walk Test” on my patients and record the results in their medical record.  I want a simple tool to help me conduct the test and create a short text statement about the test results that I could cut and paste into my full Electronic Medical Record system.  

### Design
I decided to create a website so that it would work both on a phone as well as a computer so that the user could have flexability when recording a patient. The website takes in information for the user about the patient so that the user can either submit it to a database(not implmented) or convert it to CSV format for ease of copying and pasting the results. It also has a timer function incase the user does not have a stopwatch on them. The timer only records in seconds because I assumed that the patient could walk the distance in under a minute, but just in case the timer does go past 60 seconds but will still retain the seconds format(1min 20seconds= 80seconds). That was the only tool I could think of to help the user record the timed 10 meter test since the information that changes is just the time. The input fields do have to be valid in order for it to be submitted or converted to CSV format. These were the main things that I could think of for implementing the project.

### The Look
Orignally I wanted to use a stock photo of an prostethic athelete cut out of the orignal photo but there weren't that many high resolution pictures that looked right for the website and many had a watermark on it. So I just choose to do gradiant background with the OPIE logo and fields.
